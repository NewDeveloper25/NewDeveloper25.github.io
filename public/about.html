<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, i am a new develeper looking for working opportunities and experiences to increase my skills in coding. I grew up in a loving household and strived to make my family proud. There are various times i remember as a kid being upset when i missed a day of school or was late, to the point i was the one asking my family to hurry up. During my childhood i always did my best in school and had honor roll most years of my life trying to live up to my parents expectations. After school i deviated from college and got a job to experience the work force, during this time i working in customer service and was tasked with an unoffical assisant leadership role. I have always been happy to come and help my fellow coworkers and make there day easier as sometimes it just wasn't. When i changed jobs i learned efficiency and how to figure out things on the fly as well as understanding people with limited clues on what they needed.</p><p> I first started on the track to being a web developer through input from family memebers and the cool idea of being able to make a website all by myself. Of course while i didnt go to college i instead opted for courses and self learning as i wanted to get straight into the code and understand how websites really work. Through this fast track way i was able to understand and get great foundational skills on web developement. Wish me luck i hope we can work together to achive somenthing amazing.   </p>



<p>There are are various skills i wish to obtain , currently i am learning html. Im working towards becoming a complete full stack develeper.  </p>
